x:Y0X40RAgo                                             Assign 40 spaces to x and replace the input indices with 1
                                                        The same value is also yanked to y.
           L40{                                      }  Repeat 40 times 
               Fi,40                                    Loop variable i through range 1-40
                    x@i:                                Assign character at index i to:
                        01110110@                       a number in 01110110 at index:
                                 FB(y@>i@<3)            a 3 letter substring of y starting at i, converted to binary.
                                            Y0.x        Yank(assign value) of 0 concantenated with x to y
                                                PxR0s   Print x with zeros replaced with spaces
