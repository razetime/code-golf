{(⊂∘⍋⌷⊢)+⌿(⊃⌽⍵)(⊥⍣¯1)(⊃⍵)*⍳⍺}

⍝ Explanation
{(⊂∘⍋⌷⊢)+⌿(⊃⌽⍵)(⊥⍣¯1)(⊃⍵)*⍳⍺} ⍺ → n, ⍵ → [a,b]
                          ⍳⍺  range (1..n) 
                     (⊃⍵)*    a to the power of the range
          (⊃⌽⍵)               take b from reverse of ⍵
               (⊥⍣¯1)         decode using b till it reaches zero
        +⌿                    reduce with addition along non-leading axis
                              i.e: sum the columns

    ⍋                         Get indices for ascending order
