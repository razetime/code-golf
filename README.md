[golflang-list.md](golflang-list.md) contains all the golfing langauges I've managed to document.

[anagol-tips.md](anagol-tips.md) is a bunch of tips i have for use in anarchy golf.

Contains programs or WIPs for the following sites:
- Code Golf Stack Exchange
- Anarchy Golf (http://golf.shinh.org)
- TopAnswers (https://topanswers.xyz/codegolf)
- https://code.golf
- https://weekgolf.net
- Codidact (https://codegolf.codidact.org)

I admittedly don't spend enough time on emkc, and i think kattis is utter garbage.

If you really wanna solve any of these problems you should in any case avoid looking at the solutions. This is mainly important for Anarchy golf,code.golf and weekgolf.

These may be answers, reference implementations for questions, or just programs made for fun.

The `manual` folder contains things from any site, in any order.

The `miscs` folder contains one-time programs and other random scripts.

The `SE-answers` folder contains all my Stack Exchange answers(as of latest commit), and a script to extract them into neat folders from a CSV file.
